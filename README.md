# Movie-Reviews-Management System

his project improved microservices communication by replacing hardcoded URLs with service discovery via Eureka server. Developed in Spring Boot using Spring Cloud, it utilized client-side service discovery and load balancing to enhance flexibility, scalability, fault tolerance, and resource optimization in the microservices architecture.
